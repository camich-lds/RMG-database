RMG-database - A chemistry database for RMG
*******************************************
Edit:

This fork of the RMG-database is a modified version of an older database branch. It can be used to produce mechanisms for oxygenated species, which perform better than those produced using the main branch database. The database cannot currently be contributed to the main branch without additional work to extract the new training data and groups, as several reaction families are substantially different to those in the current main branch database.  

Database expanded for the generation of oxygenated species mechanisms. Expansion performed using pre-existing resources and literature data.

This repository contains the database of chemical information used by Reaction
Mechanism Generator (RMG) to determine the chemical parameters needed by its
generated chemistry models.
